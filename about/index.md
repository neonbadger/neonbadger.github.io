# Hi, I'm Shijie Feng.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Neon_Badger), on [Github](https://github.com/neonbadger), and on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/shijiefeng).

I grew up in Shanghai, China and came to the U.S. after I finished high school. Two degrees and a wedding later, I fully embrace America as my new home, but I still miss hand-pulled beef noodles sprinkled with lots and lots of cilantros from the raucous streets of China.

In addition to my passion for noodles, I also love to code. I was learning programming on the side when my day job involved prancing around in fitted suits and carrying bulging case files. I thoroughly enjoyed being a lawyer until I moved to San Francisco, the city of the future, where I saw the opportunity to liberate my mind from the confines of what had previously been said, done, and decided upon, and create something new -- silly or not, simple or not -- but entirely of my own.

So I became restless. 

After I passed the notoriously difficult bar exam and got my license to practice law in California, I made a decision that my risk-averse, meticulously cautious lawyer self would arguably advise against: to become a programmer.

With a head full of questions and a heart full of faith, I take the leap.

Currently, I am a software engineering fellow at [Hackbright](https://hackbrightacademy.com), an immersive all-woman software engineering school. As I figure out how to hack my way into the tech world, I know I'm not alone. 

Onwards and upwards, the places I'll go!
